           HTML is a language. It has its own words (tags) and rules for 
           how those words can be put togehter. 
           HTML is made up of 4 important components:
         </p> 
         <ol>
           <li>
             Text Content (The actual text you see.)

           <li>
             Markup (How the text looks, color, arangment, etc.)
           </li>
           <li>
             References to Other Documents (Images, 
             Videos, Games etc.)
           </li>
           <li>
            Links to Other Pages (Hence, the

       </div>
       <div class="concept-description">
         <p>
           HTML Markup is made up of <b>tags</b>. These tags
           tell the computer <em>how</em> to display the text. A tag 
           <em>usually</em> consists of both an opening and a closing tag,
           with the contents in between, and the entire entity is
           referred to as an <b>element</b>. Some tags, like the 
           image tag, do not contain any text content to be displayed 
           and therefore do not have an end tag. 
           A tag can have none, one, or multiple
           <b>attributes</b> inside of it. <a href = "https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/m-48723444">

       <div class="concept-description">
         <p>
           HTML elements can be either inline, or block. Block elements 
           form an invisible box around the contents inside of them. 
           This box can be adjusted in both height and width. Inline 
           elements simply appear in line with the text.

         The "Tree-Like" Structure of HTML
       </div>
       <div class="concept-description">
         <p>
           The DOM (<b>D</b>ocument <b>O</b>bject <b>M</b>odel) refers 
           to the tree-like structure of a webpage. This tree-like, or 
           branching structure is formed because HTML can have one tag 
           nested inside another tag nested inside another tag and so on. 
           When viewed with developer tools in a browser, this structure 
           can be seen by expanding the triangle at the beginning of 
           the first element (the html tag) and continuing to expand 
           each tag until there is nothing left but text. What this triangle really represents though, is a box. You can think 
           of a well structured webpage kind of like one of those pretty 
           nesting dolls; but instead of the containers being doll shaped, 
           the containers are box shaped. There is one big doll, or box 
           (the html tag) and it contains all the other boxes, 
           or elements, neatly boxed away inside of it.

       </div>
       <div class="concept-description">
         <p>
           Everything on the web is made up of boxes. Even circles 
           are boxes; they have just been styled, using CSS, to <em>look</em>
           like circles. This is becasue a browser sees a webpage 
           as a series of boxes, nested inside of one another. When reading an 
           HTML document as text, you can see a wave of changing
           indentations running along the left side. These indentations
           indicate how deeply the element's corresponding "box" is nested 
           inside of the entire structure. This structure not only organizes 
           all the elements within a page but it also makes the code 
           easier to read. It also allows developers to easily 
           re-arrange elements on the page.

         CSS
       </div>
       <div class="concept-description">
         <p>
           CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. Like HTML, 
           it is also a language and it controls the look, 
           or style, of a webpage. One HTML file can reference 
           just one, or several CSS files in order to create the
           final, visible look, or style, of the page. You can 
           think of CSS as a set of rules that tell the browser 
           how to display certain elements. CSS allows programmers 
           to group similar elements together by giving them 
           the same class name and then specifying a style that 
           should apply to all the elements with that same class 
           name.

       <div class="concept-description">
         <p>
           CSS rules can be very general or very specific. 
           Think of it in terms of laws, there are national laws,
           state laws, municipality laws and maybe even your own
           house rules.  In CSS you can write rules that apply to 
           the entire page, or just to one section, or just one 
           box, or just one element. However, in CSS, the most 
           specific rule is applied to every element, hence the
           word Cascading.The browser goes deeper and deeper 
           into the set of rules to find the one that best 
           describes the elements, and then applies that rule. 
           This idea is known as inheritance.

        Inheritance
       </div>
       <div class="concept-description">
         <p>
           Inheritance is a feature of CSS that helps developers 
           avoid repetition. It relies on the tree-like, or 
           nesting-box structure of HTML to operate. This 
           structure creates an ancestor-descendant relationship 
           in the elements and is what allows properties to be 
           applied not only to a specified element, but also to 
           its descendants. This means that descendant elements 
           may inherit properties from any ancestor elements 
           enclosing them. Inheritance is what prevents 
           developers from having to declare certain properties 
           over and over again.

         Avoiding Repitition
       </div>
       <div class="concept-description">
         <p>
           Avoiding repetition when writing code is important 
           for several reasons. 
         </p>
         <p>
           One, it helps prevent errors. When programmers don’t 
           avoid repetition it leads to having to repeat the same, 
           or just slightly different, code over and over again 
           in many HTML elements. This leads to errors when a 
           programmer needs to make changes to something. 
           If they don’t meticulously make the same changes 
           everywhere the repeated code appears, 
           problems will arise.  
         </p>
         <p>
           Two, it provides consistency. Take this webpage for 
           example. Each lesson looks the same. By giving each 
           lesson <span class="code">div</span> the same
           <span class="code">class</span>, I am able to specify
           a style for that class in only one place. Then if I 
           need to make changes, I can go back into the style 
           rule for that class and easily revise it any way I 
           want; I do not have to search the entire document 
           for each instance of that code.
